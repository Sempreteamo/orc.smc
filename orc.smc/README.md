The goal of orc.smc is to provide **tools for implementing online rolling controlled sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods**. 
This package is designed to facilitate robust normalizing constant estimate in dynamic systems with a rolling-window setting, particularly where real-time adaptation and efficient handling of streaming data are crucial. It aims to offer a flexible and extensible framework for developing and applying advanced particle filtering techniques in evolving environments.


## Installation

You can install the development version of orc.smc like so:

```r
# Install devtools if you haven't already
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("Sempreteamo/orc.smc")
